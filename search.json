This can be extremely useful for finding bugs or looking back to how your project looked a few months ago. However, it is often more practical to review the changes made to a single file over time; this enables, for example, clear tracking of the evolution of data cleaning and analysis steps in your project.\nTo the right of the History button, there should now be a drop-down box titled (all commits). Press this box to see the other options, which should be titled “Filter by File” and “Filter by Directory.” Select the “Filter by File” option.\n\nA file-section window should appear on your screen; select the file you would like to review, e.g. myscript.R.\nYou will then get only the specific commits in which the selected file was included (i.e. when it was added, deleted, or edited). Click on any of the commit messages to view that specific commit, and scroll further down the screen to view changes made to the file during that commit.\n\nIt’s not possible to revert back to a previous commit using the RStudio interface. For that, you need to learn some command-line git which is beyond the scope of this session.",

Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

    "text": "Overview of the exercice\nIn this session, you are going to start using the version control system Git from within RStudio to keep your local workflow tidy while having access to all previous versions of your files. You will then backup your workflow online on a remote GitHub server, which will allow you to access your work from any computer, and sharing it with your collaborators or publically. Specifically, you will\n\ninstall and configure Git (as well as R and RStudio if needed), and create a GitHub account\n\ncreate a local RStudio project under version control\n\nmake changes and commit them to your local repository (i.e. save your changes locally in your version control system)\n\nconnect your local repository to your GitHub account by creating a remote GitHub repository and setting it as the ‘origin’ of your local repository from the command line. This is the procedure you will have to follow to ‘upgrade’ your former RStudio projects that were not under version control and backed-up on GitHub; but in the future, I recommend you first create a GitHub repository (your remote origin) and then clone it locally (i.e. copy it to your computer while maintaining a connection to your remote (GitHub) version). This procedure, easily done from RStudio, will be covered in the second workshop\n\npush your local changes to your remote repository (i.e. synchronise your changes to your GitHub version)\n\nOnce this workflow is set up, you can easily work with several computers or with collaborators: if you have changes in your GitHub version (if you or a collaborator pushed changes from another computer or if you made changes online, directly on GitHub), you can pull them into your local version (i.e fetch changes and merge them locally, to keep your copy up-to-date).",

This is a great first step but all of this only exists on our own computers at the moment.\nIt’s time to upload our project to GitHub!\nPutting your code on GitHub confers a number of benefits:\n\nEverything is backed up for you.\nYour project is made available to others. This is a vital part of modern scientific dissemination.\nGitHub has a range of project management and collaboration tools that work on a per-project basis.\nYour GitHub profile can be used as part of your online-identity.\n\nCreating a new repository on GitHub\n\nLog into GitHub and go to your profile page. On the repositories tab, click New\n\n\nAt the Create a new repository screen, give your repo a name and click Create Repository. In this case only, when you didn’t start by creating a repo on GitHub but want to push from an exisiting local repository for the first time like we are doing now and like you would to upgrade your old projects, do NOT select ‘create a README file’ but directly ‘Create repository’.\n\nThe Quick Setup screen gives sets of git commands that can be used in various circumstances.\nFirst, make sure you select the SSH tab (the url shown in the blue box should start with git@github.com).\nWe are then interested in …or push an existing repository from the command line. Copy these commands to the clipboard using the copy button on GitHub.\n\nIn RStudio, navigate to the git tab and click on More -&gt; New terminal\n\n\nPaste the git commands into the Shell and press Enter to execute them. Given this is your first push, you may be asked again to authenticate your identity by entering the password of your SSH key\n\nand/or prompted with such sentence in the terminal:\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\nto which you should answer yes\n\n\nWarning for Windows OS with RStudio &gt; 2022.12.0 If you get an error saying you do not have a SSH key in the appropriate location, this is due to a known bug in the RStudio / Git bash interaction which we expect to be eventually resolved with updates. A temporary solution is to open the Windows Power Shell instead of Git Bash as terminal within RStudio: for this, go to RStudio -&gt; Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Terminal -&gt; New terminals open with -&gt; choose Windows Power Shell -&gt; Click Apply -&gt; close the panel -&gt; Complete the steps above (i.e. paste or type the commands presented by your new GitHub repo) -&gt; change back the default terminal within RStudio to Git Bash.\n\n\nFinally, confirm that the project has been uploaded to your GitHub profile (you may need to refresh your GitHub page).",

Find it and click on the git tab.\n\nIf you hover the mouse pointer over the yellow ? marks in GitHub, you’ll see a tooltip telling us that the file is untracked. This means that git is not tracking versions of this file.\nTick staged for each file. In some future cases, you may want to stage only one or a few file to create a coherent commit (unit of change).\n\nAll of our files are now staged, ready for the first commit. Click on the commit button\n\nDetails of the commit will appear in the next panel. You need to specify a commit message – something descriptive about the changes you’ve made. Since this is our first commit, we’ll follow tradition and call it First Commit\nOnce you’ve typed a commit message, click on Commit and you’re done.\n\nThe following messages from git will show.\n\nClick on Close and you are done.",
