# Committing our change

**All files need to be saved before being 'committable'**. 

Now, click on the **git** tab in RStudio. You'll notice that there are two files listed -- our script, which has been modified, and our script too, which was added. Click on the staged box to stage the change to the first script.

Now click on  **Diff** to give a summary of what's changed. Lines that have been added are green. Lines that have been removed are red. From git's point of view, a modification to a line is actually two operations: the removal of the original line followed by the creation of the new line.

Add a commit message and click on commit

Now stage the second script, and commit it with a new message.
